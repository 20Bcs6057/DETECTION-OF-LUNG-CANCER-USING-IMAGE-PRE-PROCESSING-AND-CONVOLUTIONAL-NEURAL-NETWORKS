# DETECTION-OF-LUNG-CANCER-USING-IMAGE-PRE-PROCESSING-AND-CONVOLUTIONAL-NEURAL-NETWORKS
An image dataset with different lung cancer images (benign and malignant) was prepared. After various image enhancement and segmentation techniques, the dataset was used for training and testing for the model with the use of SMOTE. It is then passed as a NumPy array in the model with CNN applied.
